# SmartAlertApp
An app I created while in a team for a  university project using Adroid Studio and Java.

We used firebase authentication for the login of the app.

When a user logs in, the app asks for perimission to track the coordinates of the user.
The user then can alert an incident like a fire, tornado, earthqauke. All users that are in 
a close radius will be alerted that there is a dangerous incident near them.

## Run the app
You can run the app by downloading it, unzipping it and open it in Android Studio.
